# Machine Learning Experiments

## Algorithms

1. Iterative Reweighted Least Square (IRLS.py)
2. Latent Class Analysis (LCA.py)
3. Expectation-Maximization Algorithms (EM)
   1. Mixture of Bernoulli
      1. mix-bernoulli.py: classfify people into two groups according to their answer to a qestionnaire
      2. mix-bernoulli-digit.py: classify the images of hand-written digits (1,2,3,...)
   2. Mixture of Gaussian (mixture-of-gaussian.py)
4. Linear Regression
5. Logistic Regression
   1. logistic-regression.py: use Gradient Descent Optimizer in Tensorflow
   2. logistic-regression-IRLS.py: use Iterative Reweighted Least Square
